     <p>I have a lot of hobbies. Most of them are ones that make me think a lot instead of me actually<br>
        creating a product. My hobbies are drawing, listening to podcasts/commentaries, solving rubik's<br> 
        cubes, learning math, playing videogames, listening to music, analyzing videogames, movies, etc.,<br>
        programming, particioating in deep introspective conversations, and also practicing the bass. For<br>
        now I don't really have any outlandish hobbies because I haven't been able to stay consistent with<br>
        them. For example, I wanted to practice parkour at one point but I wasn't able to because of lack of<br>
        resources. </p>
     <p>Because of lack of resources, I needed to adapt to what I could actually do in my free time. One<br>
        thing that I usually found myself doing most of the time was thinking deeply about  life and about<br>
        what it meant. These hobbies haven't really answered the meaning of life for me but they have made<br>
        it a lot more enjoyable and interesting. These hobbies help me refelct more as a person and on who<br> 
        I should strive to be. I like how I can always have a new way to approach these hobbies everytime <br>
        I engage in them. These hobbies help me critically think and solve problems in my every day struggles.</p>
